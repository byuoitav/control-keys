# control-keys
A lightweight HTTP service - the control keys service is part of the camera control system used with the Pi Control Processors.  The control keys are a security feature that limits who can control the camera in the local room by generating a random number which the Touchpanel-UI-Microservice uses displays in the UI.  

Designed for BYU AV environments, this service provides endpoints for retrieving mappings, refreshing room data, and basic health checks.

## üöÄ How It Works

The `control-keys` service initializes a code map on startup, builds a lookup table of control key <-> preset mappings, and exposes a small set of HTTP endpoints using the Echo web framework. These endpoints allow clients to:

- Look up a preset by control key
- Look up a control key by preset
- Refresh preset mappings for a room
- Perform a health check

Internally, the service uses a `CodeMap` object that manages these mappings and handles logic for lookups and refreshes.
